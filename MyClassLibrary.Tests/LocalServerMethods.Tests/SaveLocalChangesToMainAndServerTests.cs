        //3. the move on to Text Files, Mongo DB and Cosmos DB
        
        //4. the tests will most like need to refresh the local and server test databases. CAn this be done automatically? Don't spend too long on this.
        
        //5. Once this is all working with test object then move on to Whaddon Show App. this will need a similar lot of tests as relies on correctly setup sql
        

        //Having decided on best version for local storage just do that and sql for server side in Whaddon Show App.
